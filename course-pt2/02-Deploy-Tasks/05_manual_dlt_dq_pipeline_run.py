# MAGIC # Run DLT pipeline with data quality checks
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The DLT notebooks for producing the output data has already been developed.
# MAGIC Your next task is to run the notebooks yourself.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC To run it, you shall now to manually setup a pipeline run.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ## In and out data
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ### Incoming data
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - A sample of NYC Taxi data, from Unity Catalog (UC) path `training.taxinyc_trips.yellow_taxi_trips_curated_sample`
# MAGIC - NYC population data
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ### Outgoing data product
# MAGIC
# MAGIC We produce a data product called revenue. For now it contains the following outgoing data sets:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1. `revenue_by_tripmonth`
# MAGIC 2. `revenue_by_borough`
# MAGIC 3. `revenue_per_inhabitant`
# MAGIC
# MAGIC `borough_population` is an intermediate internal dataset.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In production, the data product will be written as the UC schema `acme_transport_taxinyc.dltrevenue_w_dq`.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ## Task: Set up at DLT pipeline run.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC For each notebook, connect to the UC Shared Cluster you have been assigned, and run through the cells. Study the cells as you run them.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ### Setup the database schema where we will write data
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1. Go to `orgs/acme/domains/transport/projects/taxinyc/flows/prep/dltrevenue_w_dq/setupdb`
# MAGIC 2. Run the notebook
# MAGIC 3. Copy the database name, which will be something like `test_paldevibe_dataopsv2_e88409f3_dltrevenue_w_dq`
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ### Run the DLT pipeline
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1. Go to the Pipelines menu under Data Engineering on the left side menu
# MAGIC 2. Press `Create pipeline`
# MAGIC     1. Select `Create ETL Pipeline`
# MAGIC     1. Accept new interface, if asked. ~~Press Create advanced Pipeline.~~
# MAGIC     1. `Pipeline name`: `dltrevenue_w_dq_[your username]_manual_test`
# MAGIC     1. `Pipeline mode`: `Triggered`
# MAGIC     1. `Language for sample code`: `Python`
# MAGIC     1. ~~`Budget`: `None`~~
# MAGIC     2. ~~`Product edition`: `Advanced`~~
# MAGIC     2. ~~`Source code`: Lookup the `orgs/acme/domains/transport/projects/taxinyc/flows/prep/dltrevenue_w_dq/revenue_w_dq` notebook~~
# MAGIC     3. ~~`Destination`: Unity Catalog~~
# MAGIC     4. `Default catalog`: `acme_transport_taxinyc`
# MAGIC     5. `Default schema`: Select the name of the schema/database you created in the setupdb notebook
# MAGIC     6. ~~`Compute -> Cluster Policy`: `dlt_default_policy`. If you cannot select a policy, save and open again to edit.~~
# MAGIC     6. ~~`Channel`: `Current`~~
# MAGIC     7. Don't add any other options, or set any policies
# MAGIC     8. Add the revenue notebook
# MAGIC       a. Press `All files` on the left tab.
# MAGIC       b. Navigate to `orgs/acme/domains/transport/projects/taxinyc/flows/prep/dltrevenue_w_dq/revenue_w_dq`
# MAGIC       c. Press three dots option and select `Include in pipeline`
# MAGIC       d. When you press the Pipeline tab again, it should be listed under `Files external to pipeline folder`
# MAGIC 3. Press `Run pipeline` to run the pipeline. It can take 2-5m for the first run. Later runs are faster.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ### Investigate why the pipeline fails
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The pipeline should fail in the `revenue_by_borough` step. Why did it fail?

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md 
# MAGIC _Add reason for the failure here..._

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ### Fix the failure by changing from fail to drop in expectation
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Go to the `revenue_w_dq` notebook.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Change
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ```
# MAGIC @dlt.expect_all_or_fail()
# MAGIC ```
# MAGIC
# MAGIC To 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ```
# MAGIC @dlt.expect_all_or_drop()
# MAGIC ```
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Run pipeline again by pressing `Run pipeline`. It should now work.
